    <p>
        A gaming blog where I dive into games, chaos, opinions, and everything in between. <br/>
        If it has pixels, jump scares, nerdy stuf or a ridiculous physics engine,  — I’m talking about it.

            About the blog and me
        </h2>

        <p>So, who’s the person behind this blog?</p>

        <p>
            Let me introduce myself — my name is Helen. I’ve been living in the charming little café town of Alingsås 
            for about two years, together with my partner. This town is known as the café town, and it truly lives up to its name
            — cozy streets, hidden gems, and a relaxed pace of life that makes you feel at home immediately. It’s close enough to
            Gothenburg if I ever want the buzz of a big city, but far enough to escape the crowds and the rush.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website marks my very first step into the world of web development. It’s my first assignment 
            — a chance to build my own website, explore, experiment, and play around with ideas. And instead of keeping it purely technical, 
            I decided to combine it with something I truly love: gaming.
        </p>

        <p>
            Games haven’t always been part of my life. That spark only came later, in adulthood — and when it did, it opened up a whole new world. 
            Suddenly, I could dive into beautifully crafted stories, connect with incredible people, and discover new ways to share experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website is both my course project and my personal gaming blog. Here, I’ll share reviews, thoughts, and discoveries from the gaming world,
            while simultaneously shaping and improving the site itself. Expect honest opinions, and a lot of goofy stuff!
        </p>

        <p>
            In my next post, I’ll share what games I’m playing right now and some of my thoughts about them — so stay tuned!

                I collect mugs — but not just any mugs. My shelves are a chaotic, wonderful mix of spooky ghosts, grinning pumpkins, and all things horror‑themed. 
                But the collection doesn’t stop there. I’ve also got a soft spot for the nerdy side of life, so you’ll find Disney magic, Super Mario nostalgia, Spider‑Man swings, Venom attitude,
                and even Pennywise lurking among the cups. It’s basically a tiny museum of everything I love: creepy, cute, geeky, and gloriously weird.

            Hello and welcome back! 👋
        </h2>

        <p>
           I hope everyone is staying warm out there! As someone who absolutely does not enjoy the cold, I have to admit that the snow can be surprisingly beautiful. 
           I’d still much rather be soaking up the sun, but at least a snowy landscape beats endless gray, rainy days — or worse, slushy sidewalks that make you lose all hope of keeping your feet dry.
           Right now, in this chilly season, it feels like the perfect moment to grab a hot cup of coffee, curl up somewhere cozy, and enjoy some gaming. The cold outside makes it all the more satisfying to dive into the worlds of the games 
           I’ve been playing lately — three very different experiences that have completely captured my attention. So settle in, sip your coffee, and let’s take a look at what’s been keeping me glued to my screen while the snow falls outside.

    <article id="spiderman-remastered"><strong>🕷️Spider-Man Remastered (PS5 Pro)</strong> <!-- Emojis fungerar rakt in i HTML dokumentet pga <meta charset="UTF-8"> raden i början -->

        
        <p>
            Spider‑Man Remastered isn’t just an upgrade — it’s a full‑on <strong>transformation</strong>. Swinging through New York has always been one of gaming’s most satisfying experiences, 
            but on PS5 Pro, it becomes something else entirely. Faster, smoother, sharper, and more alive than ever before. This is the kind of remaster that doesn’t just polish the original — it elevates it.
        </p>

        <p> 
            🌆 A City That Finally Feels Alive.
             The first thing you notice is the light.
             New York doesn’t just look brighter — it breathes. Thanks to ray tracing and improved reflections, every glass window, every car hood, every skyscraper panel mirrors the world around you with stunning clarity. 
             When you swing past a building and see the entire city reflected in the windows, it’s hard not to slow down just to admire it.
             On PS4, the city was impressive. On PS5 Pro, it’s jaw‑dropping.
             
             Traffic glints realistically, puddles shimmer, and even the smallest details — like neon signs bouncing off wet pavement — make the world feel richer and more immersive.

🕸️ Swinging Has Never Felt This Good<br/>
Let’s be honest: swinging is the heart of any Spider‑Man game. And here? It’s pure magic.
The improved framerate makes every movement buttery smooth. You feel the momentum, the weight, the speed — 
and the PS5 Pro’s power means the city loads instantly, no stutters, no pop‑ins, just pure flow. It’s the closest gaming has ever come to making you feel like Spider‑Man.
There were moments where I caught myself grinning mid‑swing, just because it felt so good. <br> <br>

🥊 Combat That Hits Harder Than Ever<br>
The combat system was already fantastic, but the remaster makes it shine.
Animations are cleaner, particle effects pop more, and the DualSense controller adds subtle tension and feedback that makes every punch, dodge, and web‑shot feel tactile.

When you yank a weapon out of an enemy’s hands and feel the controller push back, it’s incredibly satisfying.<br/>

</p>

🧭 Quick Story Recap<br/>
In Spider‑Man Remastered, you step into the suit of Peter Parker at a point in his life where he’s already an experienced hero. 
New York is under threat from a rising criminal empire, supervillains are emerging from the shadows, and Peter must balance his personal life,
his job, and his responsibility as Spider‑Man. The story blends emotional moments, high‑stakes action, and cinematic 
set pieces that feel straight out of a blockbuster movie.<br/>

🔍 5 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Spider‑Man Remastered <br/>
1. The Remaster Isn’t Just Sharper — It’s Rebuilt
Many assets were reworked from the ground up for PS5, including lighting, reflections, and character models. It’s not just a resolution boost — it’s a full visual overhaul.

2. Ray‑Traced Reflections Change Everything
Windows, cars, skyscrapers, puddles — everything reflects the world around you in real time. Swing past a glass building and you’ll see the entire city mirrored behind you.

3. The City Has More Life Than Before
Crowds are denser, traffic behaves more naturally, and NPC animations have been improved. New York feels busier and more believable than in the PS4 version.

4. Combat Animations Are Smoother and More Responsive
The PS5 Pro’s power allows for higher framerates, making dodges, combos, and web‑attacks feel more fluid and satisfying.

5. Fast Travel Is Practically Instant
On PS4, fast travel had loading screens.
On PS5 Pro, it’s so fast it almost feels like cheating — blink and you’re already across the city.<br/>

⭐ Final Verdict<br/>
Spider‑Man Remastered on PS5 Pro is the definitive way to experience one of the best superhero games ever made. The improved reflections, lighting, performance, and overall polish make swinging through New York feel fresh, modern, and unbelievably fun.

Whether you’ve played the original or you’re stepping into the suit for the first time, this version is absolutely worth your time.

And honestly?
I can barely wait until I finally have time to dive into Spider‑Man 2. Knowing it’s built from the ground up for PlayStation 5 means it’s going to be even more phenomenal — bigger, faster, more detailed, and more immersive than anything before it.

    <!-- FULL REVIEW: R.E.P.O -->
    <article>
       <article id="repo-review">
    <h2>🎮 R.E.P.O. – Review</h2>

    <p>
        R.E.P.O. is a surprisingly smart mix of horror, physics-based chaos, and dark humor. 
        On the surface it looks simple, but once you jump in, it quickly turns into a tense — 
        and often hilarious — co-op experience where everything can go wrong in seconds. 
        It’s the kind of game that doesn’t just scare you, it makes you laugh because you’re scared.
    </p>

    <p>s
        In R.E.P.O., you play as a group of small, clumsy-looking robots working as a recovery team. 
        Your mission is to enter abandoned, unstable locations and retrieve valuable objects. 
        The problem? These places are haunted, dangerous, and completely unforgiving. 
        You’re not soldiers or heroes — you’re tiny robots trying to survive long enough to grab the loot and get out.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gameplay-wise, R.E.P.O. refines simple mechanics into a chaotic and highly social experience that truly shines in co-op. 
        Physics play a huge role here: objects have weight, momentum matters, and panic is your worst enemy. 
        One wrong move can turn a clean extraction into absolute disaster.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ll be honest — I love horror games… but I also struggle with them. And somehow, R.E.P.O. managed to hook me instantly. 
        From the very first session, I had genuine stomach aches from tension, screamed at my screen more than once, 
        and jumped so hard in my chair that my heart nearly left the room. Terrifying? Yes. Fun? Absolutely.
    </p>

    <p>
        What really surprised me is how the fear evolves over time. The more you play, the more confident you become. 
        As you start learning the mechanics and trusting your teammates, the game becomes less about pure fear and more about 
        controlled chaos — and it just keeps getting more fun the longer you play.
    </p>

    <p>
        The horror itself is a fun mix of tension and jump scares. One moment you’re moving slowly, listening for sounds, 
        and trying to stay quiet — and the next, poof, you’re suddenly standing face to face with an enemy. 
        Do you run? Do you hide? Has it already seen you? Or are you about to explode just from locking eyes with it? 
        The fact that you never know which enemies will appear in each run is a brilliant design choice that keeps every mission 
        unpredictable and stressful in the best way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recently, we brought another friend into the team, and R.E.P.O. really shows how much better it gets with more players. 
        The game works perfectly fine — and is still a lot of fun — with two people, but the more players you add, 
        the more chaotic, funny, and intense it becomes.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yes, this game has definitely made me jump out of my chair more times than I’d like to admit. 
        Probably because I’m mainly a console player, and R.E.P.O. is one of the first PC games where I’m actively learning 
        mouse and keyboard. Combine horror, physics-based gameplay, and unfamiliar controls, and you’ve basically unlocked a hidden hard mode.
    </p>

    <p>
        Visually, the game keeps things simple but effective. Moody lighting, eerie environments, and minimal UI help maintain immersion, 
        while procedural elements ensure that no two runs ever feel the same.
    </p>

    <h3>🔍 5 Things You Might Not Know About R.E.P.O.</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>You’re not heroes — you’re fragile robots</strong><br>
            The game constantly reminds you that you’re small, weak, and very replaceable.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Physics cause more deaths than enemies</strong><br>
            Panic, poor coordination, and dropped objects are often more dangerous than monsters.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Every run feels different because enemy types change</strong><br>
            Not knowing what you’ll face keeps tension high every single time.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Sound can betray you instantly</strong><br>
            Running, dropping objects, or panicking at the wrong time can alert things you really don’t want to meet.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>R.E.P.O. is scarier and funnier with friends</strong><br>
            Hearing your teammates panic makes everything worse — and much more entertaining.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⭐ Final Verdict</h3>

    <p>
        R.E.P.O. proves that horror doesn’t need ultra-realistic graphics to be effective. 
        Its strength lies in atmosphere, teamwork, and unpredictable moments that turn fear into laughter. 
        Whether you’re screaming, laughing, or doing both at once, this is a co-op horror experience that truly shines with friends.

    <!-- FULL REVIEW: RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE -->
   <article id="re4-remake">
        <h2>
            🎮 Resident Evil 4 Remake – Review
        </h2>

        <p>
            Resident Evil 4 Remake is more than just a visual upgrade — it’s a confident and carefully crafted 
            reimagining of one of the most influential action-horror games of all time. Powered by Capcom’s RE Engine, 
            the remake delivers stunning visuals, richer environments, and a darker, more oppressive atmosphere that 
            leans harder into survival horror than ever before.
        </p>

        <h3>Quick story recap</h3>

        <p>
            You play as Leon S. Kennedy, a U.S. government agent and survivor of the Raccoon City incident. 
            Six years after escaping the zombie outbreak, Leon is sent on a dangerous solo mission to rescue 
            the President’s daughter, Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped and taken to a remote village in Europe. 
            What starts as a simple rescue quickly turns into a brutal fight for survival against infected villagers, 
            cults, and bio-organic nightmares.
        </p>

        <p>
            Gameplay-wise, the remake refines and modernizes the original formula while staying true to what made it iconic. 
            Leon can now move and aim at the same time, stealth mechanics are fully integrated, and the knife has been expanded 
            into a core defensive tool with parries and counters. Combat feels more tactical, fluid, and intense without losing 
            the identity that made RE4 legendary.
        </p>

        <p>
            Enemy AI has also been reworked, making encounters more aggressive and unpredictable. Familiar set pieces return, 
            but often with clever twists that keep veteran players guessing and constantly on edge.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many of the original’s quick-time events have been removed or redesigned, replaced with more immersive, 
            player-controlled sequences that maintain tension without breaking immersion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Narratively, the remake stays faithful while adding more emotional weight. Characters like Ashley and Luis are 
            better written, more involved, and far more believable, which gives the story additional depth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Side quests, optional challenges, and expanded Merchant interactions encourage exploration and add replay value 
            well beyond what the original offered.
        </p>

        <p>
            Visually and sonically, Resident Evil 4 Remake is outstanding. Lighting, sound design, and environmental detail 
            work together to create a constant sense of dread — even quiet moments feel dangerous.
        </p>

        <h3>🔍 5 Things You Might Not Know About Resident Evil 4</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>RE4 almost became a supernatural horror game</strong><br>
                Early prototypes featured hallucinations and ghost-like enemies. That version was scrapped and eventually 
                evolved into Devil May Cry.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>The over-the-shoulder camera reshaped modern gaming</strong><br>
                RE4’s camera design influenced franchises like Gears of War, Dead Space, and countless third-person shooters.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>The Merchant nearly didn’t exist</strong><br>
                Capcom considered cutting him for immersion reasons — thankfully, that idea was dropped.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Enemies in the remake react to your playstyle</strong><br>
                Rely too much on sniping or choke points, and enemies will push harder and flank more aggressively.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Knife durability is a deliberate survival-horror choice</strong><br>
                Unlike the infinite knife of the original, durability forces smart decision-making and resource management.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            ⭐ Final Verdict <br/>
            Resident Evil 4 Remake strikes the perfect balance between nostalgia and modern design. 
            It respects the legacy of the original while refining its gameplay, tone, and storytelling for a new generation.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of the day, Resident Evil 4 Remake proves that not all remakes need to reinvent the wheel — 
            sometimes they just need to sharpen the knife, reload the shotgun, and let Leon do what he does best. 
            It’s tense, stylish, occasionally terrifying, and somehow still fun to replay for the tenth time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hop over to one of my best friends’ YouTube channel, watch him dive into Resident Evil 4 Remake, 
            and become part of a fun and welcoming gaming community. Trust me — it’s way more fun to scream together.
