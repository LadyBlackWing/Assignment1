            <p> 
                So, who’s the person behind this blog?
            </p>

            <p>
                Let me introduce myself — my name is Helen. I’ve been living in the charming little café town of Alingsås 
                for about two years, together with my partner. This town is known as the café town, and it truly lives up to its name
                 — cozy streets, hidden gems, and a relaxed pace of life that makes you feel at home immediately. It’s close enough to
                Gothenburg if I ever want the buzz of a big city, but far enough to escape the crowds and the rush. At the same time, 
                Alingsås has its own lively center, full of shops, cute little parks, and spots perfect for people-watching or just enjoying a sunny afternoon.
                Living here has been a wonderful balance of calm, charm, and small-town energy.
            </p>

                This website marks my very first step into the world of web development. It’s my first assignment 
                 — a chance to build my own website, explore, experiment, and play around with ideas. And instead of keeping it purely technical, 
                 I decided to combine it with something I truly love: gaming.
            </p>
                 
            <p>
                Games haven’t always been part of my life. That spark only came later, in adulthood — and when it did, it opened up a whole new world. 
                 Suddenly, I could dive into beautifully crafted stories, connect with incredible people, and discover new ways to share experiences. 
                 From video games to board games and everything in between, gaming quickly became something I couldn’t imagine life without.
            </p>

            <p> 
                This website is both my course project and my personal gaming blog. Here, I’ll share reviews, thoughts, and discoveries from the gaming world,
                while simultaneously shaping and improving the site itself. Expect honest opinions, and a lot of goofy stuff!
            </p> 

            <p>
                In my next post, I’ll share what games I’m playing right now and some of my thoughts about them — so stay tuned!

        Hello and welcome back!👋
    </h2>

    <p>
        I hope everyone is doing well out there in the cold. I don't know if you're like me and just longing for summer and warmth again? 
        Or if you like the snow and cold? Either way, this time of year is a great time to curl up on the couch or your gaming chair, 
        pull out your favorite games, and lose yourself in a completely different world.         I’m excited to share a little peek into the games I’m currently playing and why I love them.
        Grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and enjoy!

                    Spider-Man Remastered on PS5 Pro Is the Ultimate Superhero Power Trip! 
                </p>

                <p> 
                     Swinging through New York in Spider-Man Remastered on PS5 Pro is pure gaming magic. This is the definitive way to experience Insomniac’s masterpiece, 
                     and the visual upgrade is impossible to ignore. The city looks sharper, cleaner, and more alive than ever before — with real-time reflections in the skyscrapers
                     that actually mirror the world around you instead of the old blurry mess from the original release. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                     Combat is fast, fluid, and insanely satisfying as you dance between punches, gadgets, and acrobatics, taking down waves of criminals like a true superhero. 
                     But it’s the traversal that steals the show. Web-swinging feels unbelievably smooth, and with the boosted performance and visual fidelity of the PS5 Pro, every leap, dive, and wall-run feels cinematic.
                     This isn’t just a remaster — it’s Spider-Man at his absolute peak. If you want to feel like the friendly neighborhood hero while experiencing one of the best-looking open worlds in gaming right now, this is it. 
                </p>

                            🎮 R.E.P.O.
                        </h2>
                <p> 
                    R.E.P.O. is a surprisingly smart mix of horror, physics-based chaos, and dark humor. 
                    On the surface it looks simple, but once you jump in, it quickly turns into a tense — and often hilarious — co-op experience where everything can go wrong in seconds. 
                    It’s the kind of game that doesn’t just scare you, it makes you laugh because you’re scared.
                
                </p> 
                    <h3>
                        Quick story recap
                    </h3> 
                    
                    <p> 
                        In R.E.P.O., you play as a group of small, clumsy-looking robots working as a recovery team. Your mission is to enter abandoned, unstable locations and retrieve valuable objects. 
                        The problem? These places are haunted, dangerous, and completely unforgiving. You’re not soldiers or heroes — you’re tiny robots trying to survive long enough to grab the loot and get out.
                    </p> 
                
                <p> 
                    Gameplay-wise, R.E.P.O. refines simple mechanics into a chaotic and highly social experience that truly shines in co-op. 
                    Physics play a huge role here: objects have weight, momentum matters, and panic is your worst enemy. One wrong move can turn a clean extraction into absolute disaster. 
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    I’ll be honest — I love horror games… but I also struggle with them because I'm so easily frightened. And, R.E.P.O. managed to hook me instantly. From the very first session, I had genuine stomach aches from tension,
                    screamed at my screen more than once, and jumped so hard in my chair that my heart nearly left the room. Terrifying? Yes. Fun? Absolutely.

    <h2>🎮 Resident Evil 4 Remake – Review</h2>

    <p>
        Resident Evil 4 Remake is more than just a visual upgrade — it’s a confident and carefully crafted 
        reimagining of one of the most influential action-horror games of all time. Powered by Capcom’s RE Engine, 
        the remake delivers stunning visuals, richer environments, and a darker, more oppressive atmosphere that 
        leans harder into survival horror than ever before.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Quick story recap
    </h3>

    <p>
        You play as Leon S. Kennedy, a U.S. government agent and survivor of the Raccoon City incident. 
        Six years after escaping the zombie outbreak, Leon is sent on a dangerous solo mission to rescue 
        the President’s daughter, Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped and taken to a remote village in Europe. 
        What starts as a simple rescue quickly turns into a brutal fight for survival against infected villagers, 
        cults, and bio-organic nightmares.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gameplay-wise, the remake refines and modernizes the original formula while staying true to what made it iconic. 
        Leon can now move and aim at the same time, stealth mechanics are fully integrated, and the knife has been expanded 
        into a core defensive tool with parries and counters. Combat feels more tactical, fluid, and intense without losing 
        the identity that made RE4 legendary.
    </p>

    <p>
        Enemy AI has also been reworked, making encounters more aggressive and unpredictable. Familiar set pieces return, 
        but often with clever twists that keep veteran players guessing and constantly on edge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many of the original’s quick-time events have been removed or redesigned, replaced with more immersive, 
        player-controlled sequences that maintain tension without breaking immersion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Narratively, the remake stays faithful while adding more emotional weight. Characters like Ashley and Luis are 
        better written, more involved, and far more believable, which gives the story additional depth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Side quests, optional challenges, and expanded Merchant interactions encourage exploration and add replay value 
        well beyond what the original offered.
    </p>

    <p>
        Visually and sonically, Resident Evil 4 Remake is outstanding. Lighting, sound design, and environmental detail 
        work together to create a constant sense of dread — even quiet moments feel dangerous.
    </p>

    <h3>
        🧠 5 Things You Might Not Know About Resident Evil 4
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>RE4 almost became a supernatural horror game</strong><br>
            Early prototypes featured hallucinations and ghost-like enemies. That version was scrapped and eventually 
            evolved into Devil May Cry.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>The over-the-shoulder camera reshaped modern gaming</strong><br>
            RE4’s camera design influenced franchises like Gears of War, Dead Space, and countless third-person shooters.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>The Merchant nearly didn’t exist</strong><br>
            Capcom considered cutting him for immersion reasons — thankfully, that idea was dropped.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Enemies in the remake react to your playstyle</strong><br>
            Rely too much on sniping or choke points, and enemies will push harder and flank more aggressively.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Knife durability is a deliberate survival-horror choice</strong><br>
            Unlike the infinite knife of the original, durability forces smart decision-making and resource management.
        </li>
</ul>

    <p>
        ⭐ Final Verdict <br/>
            Resident Evil 4 Remake strikes the perfect balance between nostalgia and modern design. It respects the legacy of the original while refining its gameplay, tone, 
            and storytelling for a new generation. Whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer, this is survival horror done right.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the end of the day, Resident Evil 4 Remake proves that not all remakes need to reinvent the wheel — sometimes they just need to sharpen the knife, reload the shotgun, and let Leon do what he does best. 
        It’s tense, stylish, occasionally terrifying, and somehow still fun to replay for the tenth time. Whether you’re here for nostalgia or experiencing RE4 for the first time, this remake doesn’t just honor a classic —
        it reminds us why it became one in the first place. And if you’re curious about the game but would rather watch the horror unfold than survive it yourself, you’re covered. 
        Hop over to one of my best friends’ YouTube channel, watch him dive into Resident Evil 4 Remake, and become part of a fun and welcoming gaming community. Trust me — it’s way more fun to scream together.
